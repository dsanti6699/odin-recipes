        <h3>Here's a quick and easy to follow recipe for homemade cinnamon rolls!</h3>
          <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul> <li>Active Dry Yeast or Instand Yeast</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
                <li> Dark Brown Sugar</li>
                <li>Cinnamon</li>
                <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
            </ul> <br> <br>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol> <li>The first step is to mix your dry ingredients together in a big bowl and this includes the flour, sugar, and salt. After that, warm the milk and butter together, and then whisk in the yeast until it has dissolved. Then you know it can start working its magic in your dough!</li>
             <li>Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients, add the egg and then mix everything together. You do not need a stand mixer for this recipe, though you could certainly use one if desired.</li>
             <li>Transfer dough to your work surface (below, left), and then knead by hand for 3 minutes until a soft dough forms (below, right). If you’re new to yeasted doughs, my how to knead dough post and video can help with this step.</li>
             <li>Let the dough rest for 10 minutes as you prepare the filling—this gives the dough’s gluten a chance to settle and relax, which will make rolling out much easier.</li>
             <li>Roll out the dough and then top with softened butter and the brown sugar & cinnamon mixture.</li>
             <li>Roll up the dough and then use your sharpest knife to cut into 10-12 rolls.</li>
             <li>Arrange your rolls in a lightly greased 9-inch or 10-inch pan. I appreciate that this recipe makes a slightly smaller batch than most other cinnamon roll recipes.</li>
            </ol>
